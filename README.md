man, you need to dig on the internet just to find out how this board boots. <br>

Downloading an older image just to get it to boot and then you need to update the firmware, like they couldn't do that before they sold it.  How lazy!

Downloaded the Ubuntu image from Ubuntu.com for this board thinking it that's all I needed to do, NOPE!
