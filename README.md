I'll be putting my notes and development from this board on here.

# Crap Documentation again!

<br>
man, you need to dig on the internet just to find out how this board boots. <br>
<br>
Downloading an older image just to get it to boot and then you need to update the firmware, like they couldn't do that before they sold it.  How lazy!
<br>
Downloaded the Ubuntu image from Ubuntu.com for this board thinking it that's all I needed to do, NOPE!

# Update Aug 19th
<br>
After downloaoding the Ubuntu server image straight from Ubuntu and burning to SD sard it booted. The preinstalled image didn't seem to work from SD car. I  then images that image to m.2, left the switched the same for booting from sd card and bingo. It boots from sd card but makes root(/) the nvme so it runs pretty fast now.
