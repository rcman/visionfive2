I'll be putting my notes and development from this board on here.
<br>
# Crap Documentation again!

<br>
You need to dig on the internet just to find out how this board boots. <br>
<br>
Downloading an older image just to get it to boot and then you need to update the firmware, like they couldn't do that before they sold it.  How lazy!
<br>
Downloaded the Ubuntu image from Ubuntu.com for this board is all I needed? NOPE!

# Update Aug 19th
<br>
After downloaoding the Ubuntu server image straight from Ubuntu and burning to SD sard it booted. The preinstalled image didn't seem to work from SD car. I  then imagrd the new image to m.2, left the switched the same for booting from sd card and bingo. It boots from sd card but makes root(/) the nvme. pretty fast now.
<br><br>
Out of all the boards I would say this one took the least amount of time. The BPI-F3 took a month to get going. The Sipeed laptop is now back to default.  That's a work in progress.

Download the Ubuntu [Image](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/noble/release/ubuntu-24.04-live-server-riscv64.img.gz) Ubuntu 24.04 to the NVME  (NOTE: you will lose all your data) <br>
